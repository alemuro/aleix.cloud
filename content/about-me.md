Hello, I'm Aleix Murtra! I'm currently working as a *Cloud Site Reliability Engineer* at *Capside | NTT*. Here you can check a little abstract about me :)

## Hobbies 🎮

One of my growing interests is IoT. My goal is to domotize all home. Currently I have a couple of Raspberry Pi's that manages lamps, plugs, temperature sensors, cameras, TV's, music, and so on.

I work in a lot of projects with my colegues, we love cloud computing and serverless technologies, so we try to learn and implement all of these. As an example, this site is built with Hugo and is stored at Netlify :)

Now, let me answer these short questions:

* 📃️ Two **programming languages**: _JavaScript / NodeJS_, _Python_
* ☁️ Two **clouds**: <a href="https://m.do.co/c/e75b71c1abc4" target="_blank">_Digital Ocean_</a>, _Amazon Web Services_
