## Hobbies ðŸŽ® 

One of my growing interests is IoT. My goal is to domotize all home. Currently I have a couple of Raspberry Pi's that manages lamps, plugs, temperature sensors, cameras, TV's, music, and so on.

I work in a lot of projects with my colegues, we love cloud computing and serverless technologies, so we try to learn and implement all of these. As an example, this site is built with Hugo and Netlify :)
