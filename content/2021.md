Well, it's true that 2020 has been a weird year. Moreover, some good things happened as well. 

Looking back this year, I found interesting this list:
* [I've been married](https://immaleix.cat) this year! :tada:
* I went back to MANGO!
* I read three books! Ok, it's not enough, but it's a big step for me.
* I worked on 4 side projects.
* I made some PR's on Open Source projects :heart: 
* I finished more games than ever! (I played my first Zelda game)   .
* I learnt new programming languages (Golang) and new clouds (Azure / Google Cloud).
